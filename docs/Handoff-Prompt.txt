Title: Resume One Button Door App (v0.2)

Context:
I'm continuing a project that logs door knocks with Google Maps + Apps Script + Google Sheets.
I have a local folder with: index.html, app.js, config.json, backend/Code.gs, README.md, CHANGELOG.md.

State:
- Frontend reads config.json at runtime and injects the Google Maps script.
- Save is a POST (text/plain) to an Apps Script Web App URL with a shared secret.
- Sheet schema: ts_iso, reason, notes, lat, lng, address, city, state, zip, source_device, version.

My ask:
- Verify my config.json values.
- Ensure my Maps key has HTTP referrer restrictions and APIs (Maps JS + Geocoding) enabled.
- Help me add a viewer page to plot historical pins from the Sheet.
- Next features: offline queue, follow-up datetime, export CSV, and optional Places Autocomplete.

Provide concrete code with full overwrite blocks.
