## Summary

Describe the change and why it was made.

## Checklist
- [ ] I updated or confirmed the Google Sheet headers (Pins, Logs, Breadcrumbs, Config) if needed.
- [ ] If backend changed, I created a new Apps Script version and noted the new Web App URL (or confirmed no change required).
- [ ] Documentation updated (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) when appropriate.
- [ ] No secrets/API keys committed.

## Deployment notes
- Backend: update `backend/Code.gs` in Apps Script editor or push via `clasp` and create a new Web App version.
- Frontend: update `app.config.js` with the Web App URL.

## Manual verification (brief)
- Which sheet did you inspect and what rows/headers did you verify?
